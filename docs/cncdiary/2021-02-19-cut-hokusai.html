<h1 class="title">Cut a Hokusai</h1>
<div class="content">
  <p>I had come across a TSP (Traveling Salesperson Problem) art.
I liked it so much, that I decided to cut it.</p>
<p>The original image, white margins cropped,
from <a class="reference external" href="https://towardsdatascience.com/connective-art-with-np-completeness-557963b2fc39">Connective Art with NP completeness</a>.
(The original of the original is called
<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Wave_off_Kanagawa">The Great Wave off Kanagawa</a>, to be precise.)</p>
<img alt="picture of an Hokusai (made up from lines)" src="/images/2021/hoku0_0.png" />
<p>The point-only data. I made this using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/RoboTums/PyTSPArt">the article author's script</a>.</p>
<img alt="picture of an Hokusai (made up from points)" src="/images/2021/hoku0_1.svg" />
<p>Cut on an aluminum cylinder (radius about 65mm), painted.
The big black spots are cavities on cast aluminum.</p>
<img alt="picture of an Hokusai (cut on aluminum)" src="/images/2021/hoku1_1.jpg" />
<p>Initially, I intended to use his image as is (the first one).
But I got suddenly unsure abut the effects of these lines on aluminum.
So I changed from cutting lines to cutting points.
(The image was made round, just because I happened to have this cylindrical material.)</p>
<p>After cut, I realized that this is an interesting intermediate subject.
It is a woodblock print, so it's like a vector graphic,
and it is also an old classic, so it is like a realistic photo.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>There are other methods to translate pictures to cnc g-codes,
but people are mostly talking on pen plotting.</p>
<p>For example, 'squiggling' looks quite nice.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gwygonik/SquiggleDraw">SquiggleDraw</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/emsl/status/801253040401453056">Evil Mad Scientist on Twitter: SquiggleDraw!</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>But it is especially effective for delicate lines of pen plotting,
not so good for 'savage' cuts of subtractive manufacturing.</p>
<p>(Also, when doing subtractive manufacturing,
steep-angled paths and too-near paths (cuts on already cut slopes)
are not completely safe.)</p>
<p>When we get from computer graphics,
to pen plotting, laser engraving, wood cutting and metal cutting,
it gets more costly, dirty and dangerous.
So I suppose we need stronger 'reason' (specific effects) to do it.</p>
