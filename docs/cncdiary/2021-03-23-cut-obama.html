  <p>I cut Barack and Michelle Obama at the wedding
(<a class="reference external" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BZyd6fngoTA/">this</a> or
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/these-photos-from-barack-and-michelle-obamas-wedding-will-make-you-believe-in-love-again.html">this</a>),
using <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/openandclose/photo2cnccut">photo2cnccut</a>,
on 100x100 mm aluminum plate.</p>
<p>I wanted to try a more difficult subject,
and I think it turned out relatively fine.</p>
<p>I can recognize features of those small (and beautiful) faces.</p>
<p>The large black and white areas are not so unintelligible as I had thought.
(the depth-adjustment on machine was a bit hard, though).</p>
<p>For painting and finishing, there is room for improvement.
I'm not yet certain which is the best
(re-cutting, sanding or polishing? mat white or mirror finish?).</p>
